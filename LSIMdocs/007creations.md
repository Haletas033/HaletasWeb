## Creating and Deleting Meshes and Lights
Now that you are able to move the camera, meshes, and lights around you will probably be wondering how you can create and delete objects.
Luckily, that is the very topic we will cover here. To add a new mesh, first ensure you are in mesh mode (**M**).
then simply pressing **F** will add a new mesh. This mesh will be automatically selected so you can begin transforming it right away.
On the other hand, to delete a mesh simply press **DEL** and the mesh one position down will be selected.
The same logic applies for lights as well although, you can only have a max of 8 lights in a scene by default (we will go over how to change this later).

### What if I want a different mesh type?
If you want to change the mesh that will be spawned you can change it in the dropdown in the transformations panel.
Currently, the engine offers 6 standard mesh types from 0 to 5.
0. Cube (Cube is selected by default)
1. Plane (A plane is a flat surface with no depth)
2. Pyramid
3. Sphere
4. Torus (A torus is a donut-like shape)
5. Terrain (Terrain is procedurally generated and is generated with a texture)

**EDITORS NOTE:** _To more efficiently change between mesh types you can use 0-5 on the keyboard._
