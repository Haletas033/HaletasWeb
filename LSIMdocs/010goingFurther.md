Now that you have mastered the basics you should feel confident in making any scene that your heart desires (within the capabilities of the engine).

* Config files (how to use them and how they work)
* How the logging system works
* how fileIO works
This will give you a better understanding of what is happening behind the scenes and how you can modify the engine to meet your needs.
