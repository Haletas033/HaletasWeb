## Moving  Around
Upon loading into the engine, the first thing you will want to do is move around.
Fortunately this is very simple. To move around the scene you use W, A, S, and D.
This will allow you to move on the XZ plane. To move up and down use SPACE and CTRL respectively.
To look around simply hold left and move the mouse. Most of the previously mentioned information was pretty obvious and common among most 3D software, but there are two other movement controls worth mentioning related to speed.
Firstly, if you want to move around faster holding SHIFT increases the speed of the camera to twice the default amount.
Finally, if you are still not pleased with the speed using the SCROLL-WHEEL will allow you to adjust the speed further.
