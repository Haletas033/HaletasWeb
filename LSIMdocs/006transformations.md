## Transforming Meshes and Lights
While moving around a scene is cool it is basically useless if you can't move meshes and lights as well.
To begin, first ensure that the transformation gui is **open.**
Then you have to select the current mesh, at the moment because there is only one mesh we can enter **0**.
Alternatively we can press **[ or ]** to move select the previous or next mesh, and because there is only 1 mesh it will go to **0**. 
Now to move meshes and lights you can use the **arrow keys** in conjunction with **page up** and **page down.**
At the moment this will cause the meshes to move around. To get the meshes to rotate instead press **R** on the keyboard for scale press **N** and to get back to movement press **G.**
I find it easy to remember this like so:
* **G**ovement
* **R**otation
* **N**cale

Alternatively or for more precise control you can use the gui itself. Note that for scale you will currently see **Uniform scale** which scales all axes evenly. To scale axes independently you must first uncheck the box then it behaves the same as position and rotation.

Now if you instead want to move a light you must first press **L** for light mode then you can move the light in the same way as the mesh.
To get back to mesh mode press **M.**

**EDITORS NOTE:** _Currently you can only move lights and thus rotation and scale are **not** supported._
